# BSM-Decision-support-methods
The problem at hand is a multiple attribute decision making problem where the set of identified decision attributes are a mixture of quantitative and qualitative attributes. It is assumed that the preference of the decision-maker concerning the identified attributes, fulfills the independence conditions required for the use of the additive model. Following the additive model, the weight corresponding to each attribute will be calculated, the value functions for each attribute will be defined and the weighted sum method will be employed to calculate each alternative’s overall score.
